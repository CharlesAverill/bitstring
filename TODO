Major to-do items.

(1) In bitmatch operator, use patterns not expressions.

(2) Allow matching against strings.

(3) DONE - Change the syntax so { ... } surrounds match patterns.

(4) Provide UInt32 and UInt64 types.

(5) Allow for specific offsets and alignment.  Something like this:

    { start : 16;
      another : 16 : offset(256);   (* location would be 256 bits from start *)
    }

(6) and:

    { start : 16;
      another : 16 : align(32);     (* implicit 16 bit gap before this *)
    }

(7) Assertions:

    { start : 16 : assert (offset = 0); }

   (Q: Are these evaluated at compile time or at run time or selectable?)

(8) Named but unbound patterns to avoid "Warning Y: unused variable".
